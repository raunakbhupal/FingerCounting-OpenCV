# FingerCounting-OpenCV
A simple project using OpenCV that counts the number of fingers and displays it

This project is a part of an Udemy course on Computer Vision

To view the results run the code and make sure all the libraries are installed.

Also you need an USB camera for it.

When you run the code make sure you don't come in the frame for the 1st time.<br>
You will get a message which will tell you to wait.<br>
When the message goes then put your hand in the frame.<br>
And then see the results when you change your fingers.

Also feel free to change the ROI size as I have done it according to my webcam.
